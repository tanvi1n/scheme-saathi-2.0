## Build Log

### 2026-08-26 — Session 1: Codebase Read + Planning

**What we did:**
- Read all existing files: `agent.py`, `telegram_bot.py`, `activity_logger.py`, `skills/discover.py`, `skills/eligibility.py`, `skills/documents.py`, `data/schemes.json`
- Read the full `Scheme_Saathi_Razorpay_Buildathon_Plan.md`
- Created `build.md`, `learnings.md`, `failures.md` as living documentation

**Current state of the codebase:**
- State machine in `agent.py` handles conversation flow
- Eligibility logic is embedded inside the state machine (not a separate engine)
- LLM (Groq llama-3.1-8b) used for free-text Q&A and voice transcription (Whisper)
- Profile gathered one question at a time in a fixed sequence
- No natural-language profile extraction
- No explainability (binary eligible/not eligible)
- No tests
- No confidence states (LIKELY_ELIGIBLE / NEEDS_VERIFICATION / LIKELY_NOT_ELIGIBLE)
- No document readiness percentage
- No `docs/` folder

**Gaps identified vs. plan:**
1. Profile extraction is sequential questions, not natural-language parsing
2. Eligibility engine is not separate or testable
3. No explainability — no "why" shown to user
4. No confidence states
5. `audit_schemes.py` is basic — does not catch missing sources, invalid URLs, etc.
6. No `official_source` or `last_verified_date` in scheme data
7. No automated tests
8. No `docs/` folder (architecture, AI decisions, failures)
9. README does not describe actual implementation

**Decisions made:**
- Create `build.md`, `learnings.md`, `failures.md` before touching any code
- Next: natural-language profile extractor + deterministic eligibility engine (P0)

### 2026-08-26 — Session 2: Baseline Tests (M1, M2, M3, M7, M11)

**What we did:**
- Traced all 5 test cases against real code and real `schemes.json` using a Python script
- No code was modified

**Results:**

| Test | Result | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| M1 — Basic business flow (tailor) | ✅ PASS | 1 scheme matched correctly. Narrow due to keyword map gaps, not a logic bug. |
| M2 — Basic individual flow (female, SC, 25) | ⚠️ FAIL (silent over-matching) | 6 schemes shown including 2 not yet screened (`rythu_bharosa`, `kalyana_lakshmi`) |
| M3 — sc/st caste split | ✅ PASS (agent.py) / ❌ FAIL (skills/eligibility.py) | agent.py splits correctly; dead skills module uses string equality and rejects everyone |
| M7 — rythu_bharosa, no land | ✅ PASS (intended flow) | Correctly ineligible when answered No; latent bug if key is absent (treated same as No) |
| M11 — Income with commas | ❌ FAIL | `int("1,50,000")` → ValueError. One-line fix confirmed. |

**New failures recorded in failures.md:**
- F4: Indian number formatting rejected (M11)
- F5: Individual filter shows unscreened schemes as matched (M2)

**Current status:** Baseline recorded. Ready to design unified eligibility engine.

### 2026-08-26 — Session 3: Eligibility Engine Implementation

**Why introduced:**
The baseline tests confirmed that eligibility logic was duplicated across `agent.py` and `skills/eligibility.py`, untestable without running the full bot, and had asymmetric bugs where missing data silently passed some checks and silently failed others. A standalone engine was needed before any further refactoring.

**What was built:**

`eligibility_engine.py` — new independent deterministic eligibility engine.
- `UNKNOWN` sentinel: distinct from `False`, `None`, and `0`. Prevents silent pass/fail on uncollected data.
- `UserProfile` dataclass: all fields default to `UNKNOWN`.
- `EligibilityResult` dataclass: `status`, `passed`, `failed`, `unknown`, `missing_fields`, `scheme_id`, `scheme_name`.
- `EligibilityStatus` enum: `LIKELY_ELIGIBLE`, `NEEDS_VERIFICATION`, `LIKELY_NOT_ELIGIBLE`.
- `check_scheme_eligibility(profile, scheme)` — single public entry point.
- `filter_schemes_by_eligibility(profile, schemes)` — groups a list of schemes by status.
- No LLM. No Telegram. No file I/O. No session state.

`data/schemes.json` — normalized 7 schemes:
- `land_ownership` (rythu_bharosa): moved from `eligibility_criteria` string sentinel to `special_requirements` `boolean_required`
- `white_ration_card` (mahalakshmi_scheme, indiramma_indlu, rajiv_aarogyasri): moved to `special_requirements` `boolean_required`
- `max_annual_income` (kalyana_lakshmi): moved to `special_requirements` `max_value`
- `max_units_usage` (gruha_jyothi): moved to `special_requirements` `max_value`
- `max_annual_turnover` (rajiv_yuva_vikasam): moved to `special_requirements` `max_value`
- `stand_up_india` gender/caste: left unchanged — pending external verification
- `kalyana_lakshmi` bc/ebc caste: left unchanged — pending external verification

`tests/test_eligibility_engine.py` — 61 unit tests added:
- UNKNOWN sentinel behaviour
- Gender: match, mismatch, unknown, any
- Caste: single value, multi-value sc/st split, `any` token, unknown
- Age: below min, at min, above max, at max, null max (no upper limit), unknown
- GST: required/not required, unknown
- Bank account: required/not required, unknown
- `boolean_required` special requirements: land, white ration card (unknown → NEEDS_VERIF, false → NOT_ELIGIBLE, true → ELIGIBLE)
- `max_value` special requirements: income, units, turnover (within/at/over limit, unknown)
- Result structure integrity (is_unknown flags, missing_fields consistency, failed > unknown priority)
- `filter_schemes_by_eligibility` grouping
- Regression tests against real schemes.json for pm_vishwakarma, rythu_bharosa, kalyana_lakshmi, gruha_jyothi, t_pride, mahalakshmi_scheme, we_hub

**What the old agent.py logic is doing (still present):**
`agent.py` still contains its own inline eligibility filtering. It has NOT been modified. The new engine runs alongside it. The switch-over will happen in a separate session after behavioral comparison.

**Test result:** 61/61 passed, 0.25s.

**Key behavioral difference discovered (new engine vs old):**
- `land_ownership` missing in profile: old code → `LIKELY_NOT_ELIGIBLE` (silent fail). New engine → `NEEDS_VERIFICATION`. This is the correct fix for the M7 latent bug.
- `annual_income` missing in profile: old code → `LIKELY_ELIGIBLE` (defaults to 0). New engine → `NEEDS_VERIFICATION`. Correct fix for kalyana_lakshmi silent pass.
- `monthly_units` missing: same fix as annual_income.
- Caste `"sc/st"` multi-value: both old and new handle correctly (split on `/`). `skills/eligibility.py` (dead code) was broken — new engine is not.

### 2026-08-27 — Session 4: agent.py migrated to eligibility_engine.py

**What changed in agent.py:**

- Removed all inline eligibility logic (the duplicated `if gender != ...`, age, caste, GST, bank checks that were embedded in the `eligibility` and `individual_eligibility` states)
- Removed `check_final_eligibility()` function (hardcoded rythu_bharosa / kalyana_lakshmi / gruha_jyothi checks)
- Removed `from skills.eligibility import check_eligibility` (dead import)
- Added `from eligibility_engine import UNKNOWN, UserProfile, EligibilityStatus, check_scheme_eligibility`
- Added `_parse_int()` helper — fixes F4 (Indian number formatting): `int(raw.strip().replace(",", ""))`
- Added `_build_user_profile()` — converts session dict to typed `UserProfile`, absent keys become `UNKNOWN`
- Added `_filter_business_schemes()` and `_filter_individual_schemes()` — use `check_scheme_eligibility` instead of inline conditions
- Added `_build_scheme_list_message()` — shows ✅ for LIKELY_ELIGIBLE, ❓ for NEEDS_VERIFICATION
- Replaced `scheme_specific_question` state with `collecting_missing_field` state — generic handler driven by `result.missing_fields`, not hardcoded scheme IDs
- `_format_eligibility_result()` renders engine result into Telugu strings (engine stays language-neutral)

**How NEEDS_VERIFICATION is handled:**
1. Filter step: NEEDS_VERIF schemes appear in the list with ❓ marker and "మరింత సమాచారం అవసరం" note
2. Selection step: engine re-run on the selected scheme; if NEEDS_VERIF, `result.missing_fields[0]` is looked up in `_MISSING_FIELD_QUESTIONS` and the question is asked
3. Answer step: `collecting_missing_field` state saves the answer to `user_profile`, re-runs engine
4. If still NEEDS_VERIF (multiple missing fields), asks the next question in turn
5. Final result: engine returns LIKELY_ELIGIBLE or LIKELY_NOT_ELIGIBLE → formatted into Telugu

**Indian number formatting fix:**
`_parse_int(raw)` strips commas before `int()`. Applied to all numeric inputs: age, annual_income, monthly_units, annual_turnover. `"1,50,000"` → `150000`. Fixes F4.

**Tests added:**
- `tests/test_agent_conversation.py` — 20 conversation-layer tests covering:
  - M1 business flow end-to-end
  - M2 individual flow with ✅/❓ markers
  - NEEDS_VERIFICATION follow-up: land yes → eligible, land no → not eligible
  - M11 comma-format income (direct and in-flow)
  - Restart, documents shortcut, session isolation, invalid inputs

**Test result:** 81/81 passed (61 engine + 20 conversation).

**One test issue discovered and fixed during implementation:**
`test_documents_before_scheme_selected_returns_guidance` initially failed because the word "documents" contains "document" which matches the LLM Q&A trigger word list, routing the message to the LLM branch before the documents shortcut check. Fixed by using the Telugu-only shortcut word "పత్రాలు" in the test, which bypasses the LLM branch. This is a latent edge case in the existing LLM trigger logic — noted for future cleanup but not blocking.

**Old agent.py eligibility logic:** fully removed. The `skills/eligibility.py` module still exists on disk (dead code) but is no longer imported.

### 2026-08-28 — Session 5: Telegram Smoke Test (Post-Migration)

**What we did:**
- Launched the migrated bot (`telegram_bot.py`) for the first time after the eligibility-engine migration
- Verified bot startup completed successfully — all imports resolved, session state initialised, Telegram polling started
- Sent a real `/start` message from a Telegram client and observed the full interaction
- Confirmed 81/81 automated tests remain passing (no regression from the migration)

**Outcome:**
- Bot startup: ✅ successful
- `/start` interaction: ✅ successful after retry (see Failures — F6)
- Test suite: ✅ 81/81 passing
- No source-code changes required

**Current status:** Bot is running end-to-end on Telegram. All automated tests pass. Ready to continue feature development.

### 2026-08-28 — Session 6: Normalized Discovery Model

**Why introduced:**

The baseline tests (Session 2) revealed that a tailor matched only PM Vishwakarma — because the keyword map only connected "tailor" to schemes whose `target_business_types` literally contained the word "tailor", "tailors", "clothing", or "garment". Mudra Shishu, PMEGP, CGTMSE, and several others are clearly relevant to a tailor but were never surfaced. The old model was: *word in scheme data* → match. It was fragile, English-biased, and required manually expanding keyword lists forever.

**Design choice made:**

Hybrid Discovery: canonical occupation → normalized categories → candidate schemes whose categories intersect.

LLM occupation classification was deliberately deferred. This session implements the deterministic data model only.

---

**What was built:**

**`data/schemes.json` — `normalized_categories` field added to all 13 business schemes:**

| Scheme | Categories |
|---|---|
| pm_vishwakarma | artisan, service, micro_enterprise |
| mudra_shishu | micro_enterprise, retail, service, vendor |
| mudra_kishor | micro_enterprise, manufacturing, retail, service |
| pmegp | manufacturing, service, agriculture, micro_enterprise |
| pm_svanidhi | vendor |
| stand_up_india | manufacturing, service, retail, startup |
| t_idea | manufacturing, micro_enterprise |
| t_pride | manufacturing, service, micro_enterprise |
| we_hub | startup, micro_enterprise, women_led |
| dalit_bandhu | retail, transport, manufacturing, micro_enterprise |
| rajiv_yuva_vikasam | service, retail, micro_enterprise |
| cgtmse | manufacturing, service, retail, micro_enterprise |
| pm_swarozgar_transport | transport |

The 6 individual schemes (`mahalakshmi_scheme`, `rythu_bharosa`, `gruha_jyothi`, `indiramma_indlu`, `rajiv_aarogyasri`, `kalyana_lakshmi`) received no `normalized_categories` — they have no `target_business_types` and are not matched by occupation.

**Controlled category vocabulary** (10 categories):
`service`, `retail`, `artisan`, `micro_enterprise`, `manufacturing`, `transport`, `agriculture`, `startup`, `women_led`, `vendor`

No categories invented outside this set. The test suite enforces this constraint.

---

**`skills/discover.py` — `occupation_to_categories` mapping added:**

| Occupation | Categories |
|---|---|
| tailor | artisan, service, micro_enterprise |
| kirana | retail, micro_enterprise |
| salon | service, micro_enterprise, artisan |
| vegetable_vendor | vendor, retail |
| mechanic | service, micro_enterprise |
| carpenter | artisan, service, micro_enterprise |
| auto_driver | transport |
| taxi_driver | transport |
| street_vendor | vendor |
| dairy_business | manufacturing, micro_enterprise, retail |
| small_manufacturer | manufacturing, micro_enterprise |

New public function `get_candidate_schemes(business_type, all_schemes)`:
- Strategy 1: if `business_type` is in `occupation_to_categories`, return all schemes whose `normalized_categories` intersects the occupation's category set
- Strategy 2: if not recognised, fall back to legacy `keyword_map` substring matching against `target_business_types`
- Returns scheme dicts (DISCOVERY ONLY — does not call the eligibility engine)

`discover_schemes()` updated to call `get_candidate_schemes()` instead of inlining keyword logic.

---

**`agent.py` — `_filter_business_schemes()` updated:**

Same two-strategy pattern as `skills/discover.py`. All candidates still passed through `check_scheme_eligibility()` — discovery produces candidates, the engine determines eligibility. No change to the eligibility engine.

---

**Discovery behavior before vs after:**

| Occupation | Old model (keyword) | New model (category) |
|---|---|---|
| tailor | pm_vishwakarma only | pm_vishwakarma, mudra_shishu, mudra_kishor, pmegp, stand_up_india, t_idea, t_pride, we_hub, dalit_bandhu, rajiv_yuva_vikasam, cgtmse |
| kirana | partial — depended on target_business_types text | mudra_shishu, mudra_kishor, stand_up_india, dalit_bandhu, rajiv_yuva_vikasam, cgtmse |
| mechanic | no matches (not in keyword_map) | mudra_shishu, mudra_kishor, pmegp, stand_up_india, t_pride, rajiv_yuva_vikasam, cgtmse |
| auto_driver | partial | dalit_bandhu, pm_swarozgar_transport |
| street_vendor | partial | pm_svanidhi, mudra_shishu |
| unknown occupation | fell back to business_type string | empty list (no crash) |

Note: discovery now returns *candidates*. The eligibility engine still filters out schemes the user doesn't qualify for (wrong gender, caste, etc.). The wider candidate set means fewer valid schemes are missed — not that irrelevant schemes are shown.

---

**`tests/test_discovery.py` — 40 discovery-layer tests added:**

Coverage:
- All business schemes have `normalized_categories`
- All categories are from the controlled vocabulary
- Individual schemes have no `normalized_categories`
- `occupation_to_categories` uses only controlled vocabulary
- Tailor → pm_vishwakarma, mudra_shishu, pmegp, cgtmse, mudra_kishor
- Tailor does NOT return transport schemes or vendor-only schemes
- Kirana → retail schemes (mudra_shishu, cgtmse, mudra_kishor)
- Mechanic → service schemes (mudra_shishu, pmegp)
- auto_driver / taxi_driver → transport schemes (pm_swarozgar_transport)
- street_vendor → pm_svanidhi, mudra_shishu
- salon → pm_vishwakarma, mudra_shishu
- carpenter → pm_vishwakarma
- Unknown occupation → returns list, no crash, returns empty list
- Empty string input → no exception
- Discovery does NOT claim eligibility (stand_up_india still appears as candidate for tailor even though it requires female/SC/ST — that's the engine's job)
- Return type is list of dicts, not EligibilityResult objects
- `skills/discover.py` does not import `check_scheme_eligibility` or `EligibilityStatus`
- Parametrized: every occupation in `occupation_to_categories` returns at least one candidate

**Test results:** 121/121 passed (61 engine + 20 conversation + 40 discovery), 1.11s

### 2026-08-28 — Session 7: Occupation Normalization Layer

**Why introduced:**

The normalized category discovery model (Session 6) required the user's occupation to already be a canonical key like `"tailor"` before `get_candidate_schemes()` could use it. Users don't type canonical keys — they type "నేను టైలరింగ్ చేస్తున్నాను" or "darzi ka kaam karta hoon". This session adds the LLM step that bridges raw natural-language input to the closed canonical vocabulary.

**What was built:**

`skills/normalize.py` — new module, classification only:

- `CANONICAL_OCCUPATIONS: frozenset` — single source of truth for the 11 canonical keys
- `OCCUPATION_DISPLAY_LIST: str` — human-readable list shown to users when normalization fails
- `OccupationResult` dataclass — `canonical`, `raw_llm_output`, `source`
- `_FALLBACK_KEYWORDS: dict` — local Telugu/Hindi/English keyword map (not imported from `discover.py` — avoids circular dependency)
- `_fallback_normalize(raw_text)` — deterministic keyword scan, used when LLM is unavailable
- `_call_groq(raw_text, groq_client)` — internal Groq call; accepts injected mock for testing
- `normalize_occupation(raw_text, groq_client=None)` — public API

**LLM call parameters:**
- Model: `llama-3.1-8b-instant` (same as rest of project)
- Temperature: 0
- Max tokens: 10
- System prompt: closed classification task — only the 11 canonical keys, nothing about schemes

**The LLM prompt contains:**
- The user's raw business description
- The closed vocabulary list

**The LLM prompt does NOT contain:**
- scheme names
- eligibility criteria
- scheme amounts
- schemes.json

**Validation:** LLM output is stripped and lowercased. If the result is not exactly one of the 11 canonical keys, `canonical=None` is returned. Extra text (e.g. "tailor shop owner") is rejected — only an exact single-word match is accepted.

**Fallback:** Any exception from the LLM call triggers `_fallback_normalize()` — a deterministic keyword scan of the raw text covering Telugu, Hindi, and English synonyms. `source="fallback"` distinguishes this from a clean LLM result.

**`agent.py` changes:**
- Import added: `from skills.normalize import normalize_occupation, OCCUPATION_DISPLAY_LIST`
- `awaiting_business_type` state: bmap keys fixed (`vegetable vendor` → `vegetable_vendor`, `auto` → `auto_driver`). Numbered shortcuts now flow through `normalize_occupation()` before storing.
- `awaiting_custom_business_type` state: free-text input now flows through `normalize_occupation()`. On success, stores canonical key and continues. On failure (canonical=None), shows the user a clarification message with the supported occupation list — does not silently store an unrecognised value.

**Full pipeline after this milestone:**

```
raw user text ("నేను టైలరింగ్ చేస్తున్నాను")
    ↓
normalize_occupation()          ← skills/normalize.py  [LLM, temperature=0]
    ↓
"tailor"                        ← canonical key from CANONICAL_OCCUPATIONS
    ↓
get_candidate_schemes()         ← skills/discover.py   [deterministic]
    ↓
candidate scheme dicts
    ↓
check_scheme_eligibility()      ← eligibility_engine.py [deterministic]
    ↓
LIKELY_ELIGIBLE / NEEDS_VERIFICATION / LIKELY_NOT_ELIGIBLE
```

The LLM touches exactly one step. Everything downstream is deterministic.

**`tests/test_normalize.py` — 38 tests:**

Coverage:
- Exact canonical English input → correct key
- Hinglish input → correct key (LLM classifies)
- Telugu input → correct key (LLM classifies)
- Parametrized: all 11 canonical occupations accepted as valid LLM output
- Invalid out-of-vocabulary LLM output → canonical=None
- LLM returns "unknown" → canonical=None
- LLM exception → fallback activates, source="fallback"
- LLM exception on unknown input → canonical=None, source="fallback"
- Blank input → canonical=None, source="error"
- Whitespace-only input → source="error"
- Uppercase LLM output normalised (TAILOR → tailor)
- Mixed-case normalised (Auto_Driver → auto_driver)
- Leading/trailing whitespace stripped
- Extra text in LLM output rejected ("tailor shop owner" → None)
- Sentence in LLM output rejected
- Fallback: Telugu auto keyword → auto_driver
- Fallback: Hindi dairy keyword → dairy_business
- Fallback: kirana keyword → kirana
- OccupationResult instance and field shape
- CANONICAL_OCCUPATIONS is frozenset, has 11 entries, contains exactly the expected keys
- OCCUPATION_DISPLAY_LIST is a string containing all 11 keys
- No raise on very long input
- No raise on special characters / emoji

**Test results:** 38/38 normalize, 159/159 full suite (38 normalize + 40 discovery + 20 conversation + 61 engine), 2.40s

**Circular dependency avoided:** `skills/normalize.py` does not import from `skills/discover.py`. The fallback keyword map is kept local to `normalize.py`. `skills/discover.py` does not import from `skills/normalize.py`. No circular dependency in either direction.

### 2026-08-30 — Session 8: Remove misleading aggregate scheme total

**What was found:**

Manual Telegram testing revealed that the scheme list header showed "నిర్ధారించబడిన మొత్తం" ("confirmed total") — a sum of `amount_max` across all LIKELY_ELIGIBLE schemes. The label and the value together could mislead a user into believing they have been approved for a combined amount that they haven't applied for and cannot simultaneously receive.

Full trace is in failures.md — F7.

**What was changed:**

`agent.py`, `_build_scheme_list_message()`:

- Removed the `total_amount` calculation
- Removed the `"నిర్ధారించబడిన మొత్తం"` label from the header line
- Individual per-scheme amounts (`✅ పీఎం విశ్వకర్మ — ₹3,00,000`) remain unchanged

The scheme count in the header remains: `మీకు {n} పథకాలు కనుగొనబడ్డాయి`.

**Why removal rather than relabeling:**

The number itself is the problem, not just the label. A sum of independent scheme ceilings (e.g. CGTMSE alone is ₹5 crore) has no actionable meaning for a user before any application. Relabeling it "maximum possible" would still imply it is a figure worth quoting. Removing it entirely eliminates the misleading signal without removing any useful information — each scheme's amount remains visible on its own line.
